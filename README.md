# Project Setup and Execution Guide

To begin working with this project you should first ensure that Python is installed on your system, preferably version 3.9 or higher. Once Python is available you should open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project where the file `requirements.txt` is located. You should then create a virtual environment so that the dependencies remain isolated from your system packages by running the command `python3 -m venv venv` and after it is created you should activate it with `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS or Linux, or with `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. When the environment is active you should install the required packages by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which will download and configure all dependencies needed for the project.

After the installation of dependencies is complete you are ready to execute the code. The main entry point for running the project is the file `main.py`, which you should execute using the command `python main.py` from the terminal. This will initialize the program and run the pipeline as defined. If you intend to train models you should run the script `train.py` located inside the `upfall_do` folder using the command `python -m upfall_do.train`. This script handles the training process and will save the trained models in the designated directory defined in `config.py`. If you want to test or run inference you should use the `run.py` script inside the same folder by executing `python -m upfall_do.run`. The `data.py` file contains the routines for loading and preprocessing the dataset, while the `models.py` file defines the model architectures that are trained and evaluated. The `config.py` file allows you to change hyperparameters and paths, and you can adjust them before training or evaluation to suit your experiment requirements.

In summary you should start by creating and activating a virtual environment, then install the dependencies, after which you can run `main.py` to execute the overall pipeline, `train.py` to train new models, and `run.py` to evaluate or test the models. All configuration parameters are centralized in `config.py`, and the other modules support data processing and model definitions. By following these steps sequentially you will be able to set up, train, and execute the project successfully.
